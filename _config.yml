# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I’m Kulbir Singh Ahluwalia, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu/)). 
  I am committed to developing autonomous robotic systems that address real-world challenges. 
  My research explores natural language grounding for mobile field robot navigation in dynamic environments under the guidance of Girish Chowdhary and Julia Hockenmaier.  
  During my Master’s in Robotics from the University of Maryland, I was fortunate to work with Pratap Tokekar and Ryan Williams on Pasture Monitoring in Simulated Environments. 
  Besides working on my research, I enjoy working out, meditating and fine-tuning my solar-powered setup.
