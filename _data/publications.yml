  description: "We introduce an efficient active semantic mapping approach for horticultural robotics, using a mobile manipulator with an RGB-D camera. Probabilistic semantic octomaps are used to detect target regions of interest such as fruits, generate candidate viewpoints, and compute information gain for next-best-view planning. An efficient ray-casting strategy and a novel information gain function accounting for semantics and occlusions is introduced for efficient target-focused map exploration."

  # description: "This poster presents a text-enabled FarmBot system that enables users to control robotic gardening via natural language. Leveraging a custom Python wrapper built on the FarmBot REST API, natural language commands are grounded using the robot state and converted into executable code with a fine-tuned CodeT5 model. Valid plant placement configurations are generated using a unique synthetic dataset derived from uniformly sampled spatial commands with natural language defined spatial constraints."

Using a custom Python wrapper built on the FarmBot REST API, natural language commands are grounded using real-time robot state and translated into executable code with a fine-tuned CodeT5 model. The system generates valid plant placement configurations that satisfy natural language defined spatial constraints."

  description: "DeepPaSTL aims to accurately forecast long-term pasture growth, tackling the challenge of estimating pasture biomass without relying on extensive site-specific data or frequent field measurements. This approach enables predicting pasture evolution without monitoring fields regularly, using past observed pasture heights as input. DeepPaSTL introduces a bi-directional ConvLSTM encoder–decoder to learn the spatio-temporal pasture growth dynamics purely from spatial height measurements."
