I am committed to developing autonomous robotic systems that address real-world challenges.  My research explores natural language grounding for mobile field robot navigation in dynamic environments under the guidance of Girish Chowdhary and Julia Hockenmaier.   During my Master’s in Robotics from the University of Maryland, I was fortunate to work with Pratap Tokekar and Ryan Williams on Pasture Monitoring in Simulated Environments.  Besides working on my research, I enjoy working out, meditating and fine-tuning my solar-powered setup.  </subtitle></feed>
